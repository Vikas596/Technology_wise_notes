What is Docker? 

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications within 
containers. It provides a lightweight and efficient way to package applications and their dependencies, ensuring 
consistency across different environments. By using Docker, developers can focus on writing code without worrying 
about compatibility issues arising from differences in operating systems or software versions. 

Why is Docker Useful?

Docker is highly advantageous for teams due to its ability to streamline the development and deployment processes. 
By encapsulating applications in containers, Docker ensures that software runs consistently regardless of where it's 
deployed—be it a developer's laptop, a test server, or a production environment.

Key Docker Concepts

Docker Images: Think of images as blueprints or templates for containers. Each image contains everything needed to run an application, 
including the code, runtime, libraries, and settings. Importantly, from a single Docker image, you can create multiple containers—much 
like how you can build several houses from one blueprint.

Docker Containers: Containers are running instances of Docker images. They are isolated environments that execute your application 
without affecting the host system, ensuring it runs the same way regardless of where it's deployed. You can create multiple containers from the same image, 
enabling different environments or configurations as needed.

Interacting with Docker: Engine, Daemon, and CLI
To effectively work with Docker, it's important to understand its architecture and how its main components interact. Here’s how these pieces fit together:

Docker Engine: This is the core part of Docker—a client-server application that enables you to build and run containers. The Docker Engine consists of two 
main components: the Docker Daemon and the Docker CLI, which communicate via a REST API.

Docker Daemon: Also known as dockerd, the Docker Daemon is a background service that manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. 
It listens for API requests and performs the actions needed to build, run, and manage containers. The Daemon is responsible for the actual work of creating and running containers.

Docker CLI: The Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) is the tool you use to interact with Docker from your terminal. When you type a command starting with docker,
 the CLI sends your request to the Docker Daemon via the REST API. The CLI acts as the user-facing entry point for managing containers, images, and other Docker resources.

 Running Your First Docker Container
Running your first Docker container is an essential and often the first step when learning Docker. 
It provides a simple way to ensure your Docker setup is working correctly. The hello-world image is
 specially designed for this purpose; it's a minimal Docker image that, when run, displays a welcome 
 message to confirm that Docker is fully operational on your system.

To get started, open your terminal and type:

Bash
Copy to clipboard
# Run the hello-world Docker image
docker run hello-world
Here's what happens when you run this command:

Docker checks if the hello-world image is already on your computer.
If it isn't, Docker downloads it from a place called Docker Hub, an online library of pre-built images.
Once the image is ready, Docker starts the container and runs a small program that shows a welcome message.

Listing Docker Images
To see which Docker images are currently saved on your computer, use this command:

Bash
Copy to clipboard
# List all Docker images on your system
docker images
After you've run docker run hello-world, the docker images command should show:

Plain text
Copy to clipboard
REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
hello-world   latest    d2c94e258dcb   17 months ago   13.3kB

Listing Running Containers
To find out which containers are running at the moment, use the command:

Bash
Copy to clipboard
# List currently running Docker containers
docker ps
Since the hello-world container stops right after showing its message, you won't see it running:

Plain text
Copy to clipboard
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES

Listing All Containers
To view all containers on your system, whether they are currently running or have been stopped, you can use the following command.

Bash
Copy to clipboard
# List all Docker containers, both running and stopped
docker ps -a
By adding the -a option, Docker will list all containers, not just the actively running ones. This command will display a comprehensive list of every container, showing those that have finished executing, like the hello-world container. For example, the output might look like this:

Plain text
Copy to clipboard
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND    CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS     NAMES
981fddc7cbd2   hello-world   "/hello"   About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago             tender_gagarin
Here's a beginner-friendly explanation of each column and the values you might see:

CONTAINER ID: A unique identifier for each container. This serves as a shorthand reference for Docker to perform operations on the container.
IMAGE: The Docker image that was used to create the container. In this case, "hello-world" was the image utilized.
COMMAND: The command that runs when the container starts. For the hello-world container, it executed "/hello".
CREATED: The time elapsed since the container was created. For example, "About a minute ago" indicates it was created within the last minute.
STATUS: Displays the current state of the container. "Exited (0)" means the container has finished running successfully, and the number "0" typically indicates no errors occurred.
PORTS: Lists any network ports the container is using to communicate with the outside world. This might be blank if no ports are configured.
NAMES: A user-friendly name automatically assigned to the container, such as "tender_gagarin". This name can be used to identify the container instead of the long CONTAINER ID.
