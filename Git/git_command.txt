1 - Create a directory and move to that directory
mkdir my-time-machine
cd my-time-machine

2- Initializing Git Repository
git init
output - 
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/labex/project/my-time-machine/.git/

3 - status of repo in git 
git status
output-
On branch master

Git Configuration (git config) – Complete Overview
🔹 What is git config?

git config is used to set, get, and manage Git settings at different levels:

System (entire system)

Global (current user)

Local (specific repository)

🔹 Common Git Configuration Levels
Level	Scope
--system	All users on the system
--global	Current user
--local	Current repository
🔹 Essential Git Configurations
1. User Identity
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"


Used to identify commit authorship.

2. Colored Output
git config --global color.ui auto


Improves readability of Git command outputs.

3. Default Editor
git config --global core.editor nano


Defines which editor Git uses for commit messages.

4. Line Ending Handling
git config --global core.autocrlf input


Prevents line-ending issues across different operating systems.

5. Git Aliases
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:..."


Speeds up frequently used Git commands.

🔹 Local Configuration Example
git config user.name "Lab User"


Overrides global settings for a specific repository.

✅ Key Takeaways

Git configurations control behavior, identity, and usability

Global config applies everywhere

Local config is repo-specific

Aliases significantly boost productivity

Git Technology – Staging Area & File Control
🔹 1. Git Staging Area

Definition:
The staging area is an intermediate step between the working directory and commit history. It allows selecting specific changes to include in a commit.

Command:

git add <file>

🔹 2. Ignoring Files with .gitignore

Definition:
.gitignore tells Git which files or patterns should not be tracked, such as logs, temp files, or secrets.

Example:

*.log

🔹 3. Viewing Changes Before Commit

Definition:
git diff shows line-by-line changes between the working directory and the staging area.

Command:

git diff

🔹 4. Unstaging Files

Definition:
Unstaging removes files from the staging area without deleting or modifying file content.

Command:

git restore --staged <file>

🔹 5. Checking Repository Status

Definition:
Displays the current state of files: staged, unstaged, and untracked.

Command:

git status

✅ Summary

git add → move changes to staging

.gitignore → prevent unwanted files from tracking

git diff → review changes safely

git restore --staged → remove files from staging

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Git Technology – Branching & Merging
🔹 What is a Git Branch?

A branch is a separate line of development that allows working on features without affecting the main codebase.

🔹 Create a Branch
git branch <branch-name>

🔹 Switch Branches
git checkout <branch-name>
# OR
git switch <branch-name>


✔ git switch is newer and clearer (Git ≥ 2.23)

🔹 Create & Switch in One Command
git checkout -b <branch-name>
# OR
git switch -c <branch-name>

🔹 Merge Branches
git merge <branch-name>


Merges changes into the current branch.

🔹 Delete a Branch
git branch -d <branch-name>


Deletes only if fully merged (safe delete).

git branch -D <branch-name>


Force delete (use carefully).

🔹 View All Branches
git branch
git branch -a

✅ Summary

Branches isolate work

Switching controls context

Merging integrates changes

Deleting keeps repo clean

Day 6 

The Role of the ".git" Folder

When you run git init, Git creates a hidden folder called .git inside your project directory. This folder is the heart of your Git repository. It’s where Git stores everything it needs to keep track of your project’s changes and history. Although this folder is hidden and you don’t need to interact with it directly, it’s where all the behind-the-scenes work happens to manage version control.

The .git folder contains important files and directories that Git uses to store information about your project—like the changes you make, your project’s history, and metadata that helps Git do its job efficiently.

Example of What’s Inside the .git Folder:

Here’s what the structure of the .git folder might look like:

Bash
Copy to clipboard
.git/
├── HEAD
├── config
├── objects/
├── refs/
├── logs/
Let’s break down what each of these parts does, keeping it simple:

HEAD: This file helps Git keep track of your current place in the project. It tells Git which version of the project you’re working on right now.

config: This file contains settings specific to this Git repository, like information about how Git should behave or how your project is connected to other repositories (if any).

objects/: This folder stores the actual content of your project (files and changes) in a compressed format. Every time you save a change, Git creates new objects here to remember that version of your project.

refs/: This folder contains information that helps Git keep track of different points in your project’s history (like different "versions" or "states" of your project). You don’t need to worry about this too much at the start.

logs/: This folder contains records of actions you’ve taken, like when you save changes. It helps Git keep a log of what happened in your project over time.


Using ".gitignore" to Manage Untracked Files

In any Git project, there are often files or directories that you don’t want to track in version control. These could include temporary files, logs, 
build outputs, or files that are a work in progress. To manage this, Git uses a special file called .gitignore, which lists patterns to tell Git which files to ignore. 
This helps ensure that unnecessary or sensitive files are not accidentally added to the repository.
 It's crucial to add and commit the .gitignore file to the repository to ensure consistent rules for ignoring files are applied throughout the project.


"git log": Viewing the Basic History of Your Project

After making several commits, it’s useful to review the history of those changes. 
The git log command helps you do just that by showing a list of all the commits made in your project, along with important details like the author, date, and commit message.


They will see something like this:

Plain text
Copy to clipboard
commit 9d1e9b8f3b14fd93d69b64ae5b2f634344f5c620 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Alice <alice@example.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 16 09:42:15 2024 +0000

    Combine guest list and decorations

commit 2b6a19d5f45b8f3b14c34ea7f0a56e93047fbc12
Author: Bob <bob@example.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 15 14:23:37 2024 +0000

    Update menu for vegetarians


For each commit, there’s a long string of letters and numbers (such as 9d1e9b8f3b14fd93d69b64ae5b2f634344f5c620). 
This is the commit hash—a unique identifier that Git generates for each commit. It allows you to reference or revert to this specific commit later if needed.
Then, you can see the author of the commit, the date when the commit was made, and the commit message, which describes the changes. 
In this case, Alice combined the guest list and decorations, and Bob updated the menu for vegetarians.
You may also notice (HEAD -> main) next to the first commit. This means that this commit is currently at the tip of the main branch, and "HEAD" is pointing to it.    


Advanced "git log": Efficiently Searching and Filtering History

For longer projects, scrolling through the entire commit history may not always be practical. If Alice and Bob want to focus only on the most recent changes, they can limit the number of commits displayed by running:

Bash
Copy to clipboard
git log -n 3
This command will show just the last 3 commits, allowing them to quickly review the latest updates without the need to sift through older commits.


In some cases, Alice or Bob may need to search for specific commits. They can filter the commit history by author or keyword to find relevant information. For example, if Bob wants to see only the commits he made, he can use:

Bash
Copy to clipboard
git log --author="Bob"
If they need to find commits related to a specific topic, such as updates to the menu, they can search by keyword in the commit messages. Running:

Bash
Copy to clipboard
git log --grep="menu"
will display all the commits that mention "menu" in their messages, helping them locate relevant changes efficiently.

Using "git commit --amend" to Fix Mistakes

Mistakes happen, and sometimes you might realize a commit message is unclear or a small change was left out of your last commit. 
This is where git commit --amend becomes useful.
With git commit --amend, you can rewrite the most recent commit, either to edit the commit message or to include additional changes
 that you've staged. This command will open your default text editor, allowing you to modify the commit message or add any staged changes to the commit.
When using git commit --amend, it's important to apply it in the right context: use it when the commit is still local and hasn't been shared 
with a remote repository. This ensures that your history remains clean without causing potential conflicts with others’ work. However, avoid using it after
 you've shared the commit, as it can rewrite history and create confusion.

By using git commit --amend, you incorporate the missing file and update the commit message in one step, ensuring that the commit history accurately reflects all
 the changes in a single, logical commit.

 =========================================================================================

 --- Git Branches---

Imagine you want to change something in your project, but you're not sure if it will work or how it will impact the 
rest of the code. You don't want to risk breaking the stable version, so you need a way to work on it separately. 
This is where branches in Git come in.

A branch allows you to create a copy of the project where you can experiment and make changes without affecting the 
original. It’s like working in a separate workspace—whatever you do on the branch stays there until you're ready to
 either keep or discard the changes.

 Main/Master Branch

 In Git, the main branch (previously known as master) serves as the default branch of a repository. This branch typically
  holds the stable version of your project and is considered the primary development line. When you create a new repository, 
  Git automatically initializes it with a main branch. However, older repositories might still use "master" as the default.

  Main Branch Purpose:

Stability: The main branch is where the stable and ready-to-deploy version of the project resides.
Final Integration: Changes from other branches (like feature or bug-fix branches) are combined here after they've been thoroughly tested and approved.
Production-Ready: Typically, what's in the main branch is considered ready for release or deployment to users.

Understanding HEAD
In Git, HEAD is a pointer that tells you where you currently are in your project’s history. It usually points to the latest commit on the branch you're working on, such as main or bobs_part.

Tracking "HEAD" in "git Log" Output
If we want to see where the HEAD is pointing, we can simply run git log and observe the output. In the git log output, the position of HEAD is indicated next
 to the commit it points to. This provides a visual representation of your current location within the branch’s history.
  The branch name that HEAD is associated with is also displayed, giving you clear context of your working environment.

Viewing All Branches

You can view all branches in your Git repository using the git branch command. This command provides a list of all the local branches in your project, with the current (active) branch clearly marked.

Example Usage:


git branch
This displays:

A list of all branches in your repository, with the current branch marked by an asterisk *.

Viewing Branch Status with "git status"
Alongside git branch, the git status command also displays the branch you’re currently on,
 providing a quick way to confirm your active branch within your working directory

 Creating a Branch

 To create a new branch, use the following command:

git branch good_restaurants

Switching to a Branch
There are two common ways to switch to a branch in Git: git checkout and git switch. Let’s explore the difference:

git checkout:

git checkout good_restaurants

git switch:

git switch good_restaurants
Git introduced git switch as a simpler, more focused command specifically for switching branches. 
It’s designed to make switching branches easier to understand and use.

Combined: Creating and Switching in One Step
If you want to create a new branch and switch to it in one step, you can use:

With checkout:

git checkout -b party_theme
With switch:
git switch -c party_theme

======================================================================================


----Unstaged Changes and Their Impact---

Unstaged changes in Git refer to modifications in your working directory that haven't been added to the
 staging area (with git add). These are temporary changes saved on your local workspace. The main concern 
 when switching branches with unstaged changes is that Git can either overwrite or lose these changes, potentially 
 leading to confusion or data loss.

 --Strategies for Managing Unstaged Changes--

 1- Changes to Files that Exist in Other Branches:

 If you are modifying files that also exist in the branch you are switching to, be aware that unsaved changes may be lost. 
 It's crucial to save your changes in an external file or location if you do not wish to commit them.

 2- Changes to Files that Do Not Exist in Other Branches:

 When making changes to files that are not present in the branch you are switching to, these changes will typically remain. However, 
 it's still a good habit to review and ensure no relevant data is unintentionally discarded.

 --Executing Safe Branch Switches --
 When to Use "git stash"

 git stash is especially useful when:

Your work is incomplete: If you're midway through a feature and don't want to commit yet, but need to switch branches for a quick fix or review.
You’re working on multiple tasks: Stashing lets you pause one task to quickly focus on another, then return to where you left off.
You want to keep a clean commit history: Instead of committing work-in-progress changes, stash them until you’re ready to cleanly commit your final updates.

---How to Stash Changes--
To safely switch branches without committing your work, use the git stash command to save your changes temporarily:


git stash
When you run git stash, the changes are removed from your working directory, making it look like they were deleted. However, they are safely stored in the stash and can be reapplied later. It's like putting them in a temporary storage area. Now you can switch branches without worry.

Once your work is safely stashed, you can switch branches using switch or checkout commands.

Applying Stashed Changes
When you’re ready to return to your work, you can retrieve your stashed changes. There are two primary options:

Reapply Stashed Changes: Use git stash apply to reapply the stashed changes without removing them from the stash.


git stash apply
By default, git stash apply applies the most recent stash. The git stash apply command applies stashed changes to your current branch, regardless of where you originally stashed them. Be cautious, as applying stashed changes to a different branch may lead to conflicts if the changes don’t align well with the current branch’s state. This command reapplies the stashed changes to your current branch, allowing you to keep them in the stash for future use or reference.

Pop Stashed Changes: Use git stash pop to both apply the stashed changes and remove them from the stash.


git stash pop
This command restores your saved changes and removes the stash entry, cleaning up your stashes as you go.

Important Options and Tips for Stashing

Stashing Untracked Files: By default, git stash only stashes tracked files. To also stash untracked files (like newly created files), use the -u option:


git stash -u
This is helpful when you’ve added new files but don’t want to commit or lose them.

Listing Stashed Changes: If you have multiple stashes, you can view them with:


git stash list
This command shows a list of all your stashed changes, helping you keep track of what's saved. The output will look like this:


stash@{0}: WIP on main: 1234567 Update README
stash@{1}: WIP on feature-branch: 89abcde Fix typo
stash@{2}: WIP on bugfix: fedcba9 Adjust footer
Each stash is listed with its index, creation message, and relevant branch.

Applying a Specific Stash: To apply a specific stash from the list, use the following command with the stash index:


git stash apply stash@{1}
This applies the changes from the specified stash entry, allowing you to restore work from any point in your stash list.

Clearing Stashes: Once you're done with stashed changes, you can clean up your stash list with:


git stash clear
This command removes all stashed entries, useful when you're sure you no longer need them.

Deleting Branches

To delete a branch from your local repository, ensure you are on a different branch than the one you wish to delete. Then, use the following command:


git branch -d <branch-name>
This command deletes the specified branch locally, but only if it has been fully merged with the current branch. It’s a safe way to ensure that no important changes are accidentally lost.

If you need to delete a branch that hasn’t been merged yet, and you’re sure you no longer need it, you can force the deletion with:


git branch -D <branch-name>
The -D option forcefully deletes the branch, even if it hasn’t been merged. This should be used cautiously, as any unmerged changes in the branch will be permanently lost. Make sure you are on a different branch before performing this action.


Renaming Branches

ou can rename your current branch or any other branch with the following command:

To rename the branch you're currently on:


git branch -m <new-branch-name>
This command renames the branch you're currently working on.

To rename a branch you're not currently on:


git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>
This allows you to rename a different branch without having to switch to it first.
